# StockScout Trend Birth — Persistent Project Log

This file is the durable handoff for `Garrincha077/StockScout-Trend-Birth`.

Update it after every meaningful code, workflow, data-contract, research-methodology or product-architecture change.

## 2026-08-26 — Greenfield repository bootstrap

- Repository: `Garrincha077/StockScout-Trend-Birth`.
- Branch: `main`.
- Bootstrap commits:
  - `85683572d08fbcb3b5ce0e5e96e1088ff189a756` — README / product thesis;
  - `f7dc973607332c9a70e1019c660a0f937cec404b` — full Trend Birth roadmap;
  - `2aa41ad69f83b883ad1ba1057aa1ab1181737877` — Stage 1 accumulation/range model;
  - `0af1a0844c5d4fef4f58c5757c2bd4c00e59c26a` — initial greenfield architecture;
  - `2fc2f3de49cf47c31a668b440aaf8006a2a1b3f0` — agent/research/implementation rules;
  - `ffe0bd7e3ec52e72285e1988b377cd17fb412ca6` — historical research workspace;
  - `abd1bd5e2c4b331c965a6687a5505deda37ba16f` — Step A field-gap audit template.
- Product decision: **LEGACY remains a separate swing trading / momentum setup engine. StockScout Trend Birth is a position/trend + investing discovery engine focused on early structural trend birth.**
- Core lifecycle baseline: `DORMANT -> ACCUMULATING -> AWAKENING -> LATE STAGE 1 -> STAGE 1->2 -> EARLY LEADER -> ESTABLISHED LEADER -> MATURE/LATE CYCLE`.
- Stage 1 decision: long Stage 1 is modeled as a dynamic range process. StockScout should look for accumulation-like demand, supply absorption, undercut/reclaim behavior, shrinking pullbacks, rising internal lows, upper-half occupancy, tightening and upper-range acceptance **before** requiring breakout.
- Research language guardrail: observable price/volume behavior may be described as accumulation-like, absorption-like or institutional-looking; the system must not claim that specific institutions are buying/selling without direct evidence.
- Architecture decision: `Garrincha077/StockScreener-next` is a reference/source of proven infrastructure, not an architectural constraint. Components must be audited as `KEEP / EXTEND / REPLACE / DROP` before selective reuse. `Garrincha077/stock-screener2` is not to be modified from this project.
- Ranking/scoring decision: no commitment to Opportunity v2 or any current StockScout score. Do not build a new opaque mega-score before raw evidence and historical studies are understood. Lifecycle/state-first ranking is the preferred hypothesis, pending evidence.
- Affected files: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/STAGE1_ACCUMULATION_MODEL.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/FIELD_GAP_AUDIT.md`, `research/README.md`, and this log.
- Behavior/model impact: documentation/research architecture only. No executable scanner, ranking, scoring, workflow, publication path or production behavior exists in this repo yet.
- Tests/audits/CI: none required for documentation-only bootstrap; no CI-green claim is made.
- Main regression/methodological risks: survivor bias, look-ahead bias in fundamentals/universe membership, mistaking one-off volume spikes for accumulation, overfitting Stage 1 range rules, and importing mature-momentum biases from the current-generation StockScout ranking.

**Next logical step**
- Execute **Step A — Architecture and historical audit** against `Garrincha077/StockScreener-next`.
- Fill `docs/FIELD_GAP_AUDIT.md` with exact source files/functions and classify Stage, RS, MA Cluster, Emerging Leader, Opportunity v2, Group Leadership, Fundamentals, chart/data infrastructure and relevant utilities as `KEEP / EXTEND / REPLACE / DROP`.
- Do not begin ranking redesign until the audit identifies what data/history are actually available and which fields need new point-in-time reconstruction.
